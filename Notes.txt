    @Entity

    @Service

    Repository is an interface and uses the anotation @Repository. Repository is limited to perform operations on a single Entity, hence we need to use
    Services to perform and interact data from multiple repositories.

    Repositories can inject other Repositories , Services can inject multiple repositories and other Services, whereas controllers can inject multiple Services
    and multiple Repositories.
